# Twitterbot
* Pet Project
* Simple Tweet Scheduler
* Twitter already has a tweet scheduler, but does not support scheduling tweets with images, this allows to do so
* Utilizes Tweepy (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and creates a simple GUI to store and schedule messages to tweet at a later time
